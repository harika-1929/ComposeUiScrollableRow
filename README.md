This Project is a Simple Scrollable row of recycler View Items using Compose UI.

I have Declared all the code in a single file(Main Activity) defined the composable functions for individual Item, recycler View and a function for previewing the screen.

I have also Declared a Data Class that has items that I want to display in the card.

The output preview is as follows: <img width="224" alt="image" src="https://github.com/harika-1929/ComposeUiScrollableRow/assets/56109065/bb76d837-e764-45cd-9790-8a048f62435a">
